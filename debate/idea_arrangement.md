# topic 1:                                                                  A. Cold dark matter is incompatible with structure on galactic scales 



## Q1: Core/Cusp problem( the small-scale crisis in cosmology):

### observation：

Observations seem to indicate an approximately constant dark matter density in tne inner parts of galaxies.

core model

rotation curve rises in a linear fashion

### simulation:

cosmological computer simulations indicate a steep power-law-like behaviour. (1997，N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universe.   center: $\{rho} \propto r^-2$  )

cusp model

rotation curve rise as the square-root of the radius

## Q2: The missing satellite problem (the deficiency of satellites in galactic halos) (substructure problem) (missing dwarf problem)

The CDM cosmological model predicts that massive galaxies such as Milky Way be sorrounded by large numbers of dark matter dominated satellite halos

Either the hierachical model  is fundamentally wrong or the substructure lumps are present in the Galatic halo but contain too few baryons to be observed.

# topic 2:   																	C. The stellar initial mass function is not universal

# topic 3:   															    E. AGN feedback is the main process that quenches massive galaxies and keeps them quenched.

### observation：the expotential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function predicated by $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology.

possible reason: AGN feedback of radio source supresses cooling to reduce gas condensation.
