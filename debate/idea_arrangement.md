# topic 1:                                                                  A. Cold dark matter is incompatible with structure on galactic scales 

## Q1: Core/Cusp problem( the small-scale crisis in cosmology):

### Observation：

Observations seem to indicate an approximately constant dark matter density in tne inner parts of galaxies.

core model

rotation curve rises in a linear fashion

### Simulation:

cosmological computer simulations indicate a steep power-law-like behaviour. (1997，N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universe.   center: $\rho \propto r^-2$  )

cusp model

rotation curve rise as the square-root of the radius

## Q2: The missing satellite problem (the deficiency of satellites in galactic halos) (substructure problem) (missing dwarf problem)

The CDM cosmological model predicts that massive galaxies such as Milky Way be sorrounded by large numbers of dark matter dominated satellite halos

Either the hierachical model  is fundamentally wrong or the substructure lumps are present in the Galatic halo but contain too few baryons to be observed.

## Solutions in future

High quality observations and self-consistent astrophysic models

# topic 2:   																	C. The stellar initial mass function is not universal

## Universal:

### Thought:

simplicity

### Evidence:

Surprisingly good  agreement between the field star and cluster IMF found in late 1950s.

Some studies claimed some convergence on the cluster and field star subsolar IMF.

There is no evidence for a systematic dependence of the IMF on gas or star density, metallicity, galactocentric radius, or time in our own or any other galaxy.

## Not uiversal:

### Thought:

It's extremely difficult to imagine that the observed complexity of star formation results in a universal IMF.

### Evidence:

The uncertainties in empirical IMF estimates may be so large.

Variations in $\Gamma$ amongopen cluster IMFs in this same mass range have not decreased despite numerous detailed studies.

Evidence is found for an IMF that varies systematically with galaxy velocity dispersion and $\alpha-enhancement$. Steeper IMFs are found in more massive systems.

# topic 3:   															    E. AGN feedback is the main process that quenches massive galaxies and keeps them quenched.

### Observation：the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function predicated by $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology. 

Mayby AGN feedback of radio source supresses cooling to reduce gas condensation.

### Simulation: AGN feedback is important for quenching star formation in the remnant of mergers.

AGN paly a maintencance role by coupling to the hot IGM and prevent it from cooling.  

Massive blackhoes can drive powerful winds to quench star formation.

### However, some people think that SAMBA bursts may trigger the active galactivity and gravtitational heating process through the release of potential energy from infalling stellar clumps will also help required quenching. 

### Solutions in future

New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation and lead a expansion in observational data in all modes of AGN feedback.
